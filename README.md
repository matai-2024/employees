# Employees

A project I'm using to practice multi-input forms in react.

To do:
- [ ] Once the form is submitted, redirect the user to a page (or re-render) that says their data has been submitted.
- [ ] Add a log-in function.
- [ ] If a user is logged in, they can edit their own details.
- [ ] If a user is a logged in AND admin or higher, they can edit any details.
- [ ] If the user is a super admin, they can delete employees.
